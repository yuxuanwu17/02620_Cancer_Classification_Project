# Course Project - Machine Learning For Scientist 

## Required Libarary

Python3
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
pytorch

All the jupyter notebook are self-contained and runnable!

## Orginal Dataset (too larget to include)

https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?cohort=GDC%20TCGA%20Breast%20Cancer%20(BRCA)&removeHub=https%3A%2F%2Fxena.treehouse.gi.ucsc.edu%3A443

## Self Implemented Machine Learning Alogrithm

    self-implemented decision tree model: decision_tree.ipynb
    self-implemented adaboost model: adaboost.ipynb
    

## MLP with Pytorch

BRCA_DEG_DL.ipynb     
LUAD_DEG_DL.ipynb

BRCA_select_DL.ipynb  
LUAD_select_DL.ipynb

## Follow-Up Testing and Analysis

Model Performance Measure:

    model_test_brca.ipynb
    model_test_luad.ipynb

Model Performance Measure Result (in ./results directory):
    
    luad_result.csv
    brca_result.csv
    
Model Intepretation:

    feature_importance_brca.ipynb
    feature_importance_luad.ipynb

Model Intepretation Result (in ./results directory):

    decision_tree_importance_gene_brca.csv
    decision_tree_importance_gene_brca.csv

## DEG data preprocessing
